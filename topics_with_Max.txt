cluster 0 contains mostly videos from democrats, and have topic about trump, if we got negative sentiments then we can conclude that this cluster contain videos that hate on trump


7, 8, 9 - this contains mostly topics that are in the elction program of democrats and democrats

republican - mostly talk about a single occuring event, scandals, smth that bring people

demoicrats talk about social problems or general problems of America. Shooting, easy weapon access



It is hard to validate the topic detection, because we don't have a ground thruth for videos. 


Filter out the clusters with 100% spectrum score, they are misleading and contain small amount of videos inside of them
